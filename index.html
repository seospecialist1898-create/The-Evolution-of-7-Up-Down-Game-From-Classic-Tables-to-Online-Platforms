            <h2>The Origins of 7 Up 7 Down</h2>
            <p>7 Up 7 Down is a simple yet exhilarating dice game that has captured the hearts of gamblers worldwide, particularly in India. Its roots trace back to traditional casino games where players bet on the outcome of two dice. While its exact origins are unclear, similar dice-based games have been played for centuries across cultures, from ancient China to European gaming houses.</p>
            <p>The game’s core mechanic—predicting whether the sum of two dice will be less than 7, exactly 7, or more than 7—made it a staple in physical casinos. Its simplicity and fast-paced nature appealed to both novice and seasoned players.
