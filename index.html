            <p>The beauty of 7 Up 7 Down lies in its straightforward rules. Here’s how to get started:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Place Your Bet:</strong> The game table has three betting options: 7 Down (sum of 2–6), Lucky 7 (sum equals 7), or 7 Up (sum of 8–12). Place your chips on one or two of these options within the time limit.</li>
                <li><strong>Dice Roll:</strong> The dealer shakes two dice in a covered jar and reveals the result.</li>
                <li><strong>Determine the Outcome:</strong> Add the numbers on the dice. If the sum matches your bet, you win! Payouts are:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>7 Down:</strong> 1:1 (double your bet)</li>
                        <li><strong>7 Up:</strong> 1:1 (double your bet)</li>
                        <li><strong>Lucky 7:</strong> 4:1 (quadruple your bet)</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Collect Winnings or Try Again:</strong> If you win, collect your payout. If not, place a new bet for the next round.</li>

            <h2>Strategies to Win at 7 Up 7 Down</h2>
            <p>While 7 Up 7 Down is a game of chance, smart strategies can improve your odds and enhance your experience. Here are some beginner-friendly tips:</p>
            <h3>1. Understand the Odds</h3>
            <p>Each betting option has different probabilities:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>7 Up or 7 Down:</strong> 41.67% chance (15/36 combinations)</li>
                <li><strong>Lucky 7:</strong> 16.67% chance (6/36 combinations)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Betting on 7 Up or 7 Down gives you a higher chance of winning, though the payout is lower. Lucky 7 is riskier but offers a bigger reward.</p>

            <h3>2. Manage Your Bankroll</h3>
            <p>Set a budget before you start playing and stick to it. For example, allocate $50 for a session and avoid chasing losses by betting more than you can afford.</p>

            <h3>3. Avoid the Martingale Trap</h3>
            <p>The Martingale system—doubling your bet after a loss—can be tempting but risky. If you lose several rounds in a row, you could deplete your bankroll quickly. Use it cautiously, if at all.</p>

            <h3>4. Start with Small Bets</h3>
            <p>As a beginner, place smaller bets to get a feel for the game. This minimizes risk while you learn the flow of the game.</p>

            <h3>5. Observe Patterns (But Don’t Rely on Them)</h3>
            <p>Each dice roll is independent, so past results don’t predict future outcomes. However, observing the game for a few rounds can help you feel more confident in your bets.</p>
